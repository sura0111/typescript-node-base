# Node.js project base written in Typescript
I wanted to use pre-configured NodeJs code using Typescript for my own projects. And that's it. This is a simple Node.js project written in Typescript. 

## Command List
```bash
yarn build # removes dist folder then creates output files in dist folder
yarn clear # removes dist folder
yarn compile # creates output file in dist folder
yarn execute # use this to execute specific .ts file
yarn lint # use this to fix all code styles
yarn postpublish
yarn prepublish
yarn start # executes .src/index.ts file
```
